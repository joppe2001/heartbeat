[2025-01-31 06:19:22 PM] Initialization of the amazing journal feature

[2025-01-31 06:20:50 PM] currently setting up the base of the project, making sure everything is well structured so that the rest of development will be as smooth as can be.

[2025-01-31 06:54:16 PM] walking through all of the data to figure out what were dealing with and what the plan of attack is going to be

[2025-01-31 07:13:46 PM] Data Analysis Findings:
- Dataset size: 87,554 samples with 187 features + 1 target column
- Classification task with 5 classes (0-4)
- Significant class imbalance:
  * Class 0: 82.77% (Normal)
  * Class 4: 7.35% (Type 4 Arrhythmia)
  * Class 2: 6.61% (Type 2 Arrhythmia)
  * Class 1: 2.54% (Type 1 Arrhythmia)
  * Class 3: 0.73% (Type 3 Arrhythmia)
- Each sample appears to be a normalized time series (values between 0-1)

[2025-01-31 07:16:57 PM] prior log was about the training set ofcourse. i was being very blind for a second there

[2025-01-31 07:28:52 PM] Key Challenges Identified:
1. Severe Class Imbalance:
   - Need to address 82.77% dominance of normal cases
   - Class 3 is particularly underrepresented (0.73%)
   Strategy options:
   - Oversampling minorities (SMOTE?)
   - Class weights in loss function
   - Stratified sampling

2. Time Series Classification:
   - 187 time steps per sample
   - Normalized data (good for neural networks)
   - Need to capture temporal patterns

3. Medical Context:
   - False negatives more costly than false positives
   - Need to focus on recall for abnormal classes

[2025-01-31 07:33:07 PM] Planned Next Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Create train/validation/test split (stratified!)
   - Implement data augmentation for minority classes
   - Consider windowing or segmentation techniques

2. Baseline Model:
   - Start with simple 1D CNN
   - Implement with class weights
   - Focus on recall metrics

3. Evaluation Setup:
   - Implement custom metrics focusing on recall
   - Set up cross-validation with stratification
   - Create confusion matrix visualization

[2025-01-31 07:39:54 PM] Initial Research Phase:
Background:
- Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat pattern
- We have 5 classes (likely different types of patterns)
- Time series classification problem
- Medical context means recall is crucial

Initial Hypotheses:
1. Due to sequential nature of ECG data:
   - 1D CNNs might be good at detecting local patterns
   - Transformers might capture long-range dependencies
   
2. Class imbalance challenges:
   - Using weighted loss functions should help with minority classes
   - Oversampling might improve minority class detection

Research Questions:
1. Which architectures are commonly used for ECG classification?
2. What techniques handle severe class imbalance in medical data?

[2025-01-31 08:06:53 PM] set up most of the base line tests for this project to start monitoring and testing the results for hypothesis

[2025-01-31 08:16:37 PM] Initial Analysis & Hypotheses:
Data Characteristics:
- 5 classes of arrhythmia with significant imbalance (82.77% class 0)
- 187 features (time series data points)
- 87,554 samples

Hypotheses:
1. Simple 1D CNN (our baseline) might struggle with:
   - Class imbalance (even with weights)
   - Long-range dependencies in ECG signals
   
2. Potential Improvements to Test:
   - Add more conv layers with different kernel sizes
   - Try attention mechanism for long-range patterns
   - Data augmentation for minority classes
   
Initial Focus:

- Prioritize recall for abnormal classes (medical context)

[2025-01-31 08:20:59 PM] Experiment Plan:
Phase 1 - Baseline Validation:
- Run current CNN with different hyperparameters:
  * Learning rates: [0.001, 0.0001]
  * Batch sizes: [32, 64, 128]
  * Number of conv layers: [2, 3, 4]

Phase 2 - Architecture Exploration:
1. CNN Variants:
   - ResNet-style connections
   - Different kernel sizes
   - Deeper networks

2. Transformer Approach:
   - Basic transformer
   - CNN + Attention hybrid

Phase 3 - Data Handling:
- Oversampling minorities

- Cross-validation for robust evaluation

[2025-01-31 08:33:39 PM] creating better terminal feedback for the training session

[2025-01-31 08:47:00 PM] Next Experiment Planning:
Will implement confusion matrix visualization and per-class metrics
to better understand where the model struggles before making
architecture modifications.

[2025-01-31 09:06:41 PM] edited the server script for more robust operations. ( might need to look more into this ) server is for mlflow

[2025-01-31 09:10:39 PM] First Baseline Results:
Training Metrics:
- Best Average Recall: 0.9310 (93.10%)
- Early stopping triggered at epoch 20/50
- Training time: ~9 minutes
- Dataset split:
  * Training:   61,287 samples
  * Validation: 13,133 samples
  * Test:       13,134 samples

Analysis:
1. Model Performance:
   - Surprisingly good baseline performance (>93% avg recall)
   - Early stopping suggests good convergence
   - Quick training time indicates efficient architecture

2. Observations vs Initial Hypotheses:
   + The CNN handled class imbalance better than expected
   + Weighted loss function seems effective
   - Need to analyze per-class recall to verify minority class performance
   
3. Next Steps:
   a) Detailed Analysis Needed:
      - Generate confusion matrix
      - Calculate per-class precision/recall
      - Look for patterns in misclassifications
   
   b) Potential Improvements:
      - Try deeper architecture (current model converged quickly)
      - Experiment with different kernel sizes
      - Consider data augmentation for minority classes
      
4. Questions to Address:
   - Are we overfitting despite good validation metrics?
   - How does performance vary across different arrhythmia types?
   - Could we achieve similar results with a simpler model?

[2025-01-31 09:34:23 PM] [2025-01-31 21:15:00 PM] Understanding Our Metrics:
Recall Significance in Arrhythmia Detection:
- Recall = (Correctly Caught Cases) / (Total Actual Cases)
- For each class, recall tells us: "What percentage of actual cases did we catch?"
- Example interpretation:
  * If recall_class_3 = 0.93, we caught 93% of all Type 3 Arrhythmia cases
  * The remaining 7% were missed diagnoses (false negatives)

Why 93.10% Average Recall is Important:
1. Medical Impact:
   - Each percentage point represents real cases
   - Missing an arrhythmia (false negative) could be life-threatening
   - Our 93.10% means we're catching most cases, but still missing ~7%

2. Per-Class Analysis Needed:
   - Current 93.10% is averaged across classes
   - Need to verify recall for minority classes (especially Class 3: 0.73%)
   - A high recall on majority class (Normal) might be masking poor performance on critical minority cases

Next Action Items:
1. Generate per-class recall metrics
2. Analyze which types of arrhythmia we're missing most
3. Focus improvements on the most critical misses

[2025-01-31 09:36:00 PM] [2025-01-31 21:35:00 PM] Detailed Baseline Results Analysis:
Per-Class Performance:
1. Normal (Class 0):
   - Recall: 0.95 (caught 95% of normal cases)
   - Precision: 0.99
   - Very strong performance on majority class

2. Type 1 Arrhythmia:
   - Recall: 0.87 (caught 87% of cases)
   - Precision: 0.52
   - Good at finding cases but many false positives

3. Type 2 Arrhythmia:
   - Recall: 0.94 (caught 94% of cases)
   - Precision: 0.91
   - Excellent balanced performance

4. Type 3 Arrhythmia (Rarest):
   - Recall: 0.90 (caught 90% of cases)
   - Precision: 0.31
   - High false positive rate but catching most cases

5. Type 4 Arrhythmia:
   - Recall: 0.99 (caught 99% of cases)
   - Precision: 0.94
   - Best performing class overall

Key Insights:
1. Misclassification Patterns:
   - Class 0 (Normal): 546 misses despite being majority class
   - Class 1: 43 misses with low precision (many false positives)
   - Class 3: Only 10 misses but very low precision (0.31)
   - Class 4: Exceptional performance (only 5 misses)

2. Trade-offs:
   + High recall across all classes (0.87-0.99)
   - Precision varies significantly (0.31-0.99)
   - Model tends to overpredict minority classes (especially Type 3)

Next Steps Based on Results:
1. Focus Areas:
   - Improve precision for Type 3 while maintaining high recall
   - Reduce false positives in Type 1 classification
   - Investigate why Type 4 performs so well (potential insights)

2. Architecture Adjustments:
   - Consider adding features to better distinguish Type 1 and 3
   - Maybe current model is too powerful (overfitting to minorities)
   - Try simpler architecture for Type 1 and 3 classification

3. Data Strategies:
   - Analyze misclassified cases for patterns
   - Consider separate binary classifiers for problematic classes
   - Review if data augmentation is needed given high recall

[2025-01-31 09:44:37 PM] Moving to Next Model Architecture:
Baseline Model Achievement Summary:
- Strong overall performance (0.93 avg recall)
- Particularly strong on Class 4 (0.99 recall, 0.94 precision)
- Areas for improvement: precision on Class 1 (0.52) and Class 3 (0.31)

Next Model: ResNet-Style CNN
Rationale:
1. Building on CNN success:
   - Keep the effective convolution base
   - Add skip connections for better gradient flow
   - Deeper architecture while preventing vanishing gradients

2. Expected Improvements:
   - Better feature hierarchy with deeper layers
   - Skip connections might help capture both local and broader patterns
   - Potentially improve precision while maintaining high recall

Architecture Plan:
- Start with 4 ResNet blocks
- Each block: Conv1D -> BatchNorm -> ReLU -> Conv1D + Skip Connection
- Global Average Pooling before classification head
- Keep weighted loss function (proved effective)

Experiment Configuration:
- Learning rate: 0.001 (same as baseline)
- Batch size: 32 (worked well)
- Early stopping patience: 5 epochs
- Monitor average recall for consistency

Success Criteria:
- Maintain >0.90 recall across all classes
- Improve precision for Classes 1 and 3
- Keep or improve Class 4's excellent performance
